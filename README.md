#Expense Tracker

A React app that helps us track the expenses of the user. You can all visualize the expense on a Donut graph which I will be created dynamically based on users input. I have used react-chartjs package for my chat. Also I have integrated Speechly a which can recognise you voice while holding the speaker icon. It will auto input the input fields based on you words while holding the speaker icon.
